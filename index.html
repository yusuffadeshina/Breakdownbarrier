						<h2>Muna Shafie</h2>
						<p> I have been in the field of education since 2014, beginning my career in primary and secondary schools, where I focused on inclusion and supported children and young people at risk of exclusion. This experience ignited my passion for continuing my career in education, particularly in helping the most vulnerable children transition through their educational journeys and providing them with the necessary support. I hold diplomas in Education, a teaching degree, and certifications in Mental and Emotional Health, Attachment, Trauma, and CELTA. In 2017, I transitioned to Further Education and have since been working as a lecturer. My role includes delivering a 12-week course for young people who are NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training) in Bristol. Beyond teaching, I am committed to understanding the diverse needs of my students, ensuring they receive the support necessary to overcome the barriers they face. I organise and deliver various workshops centred around personal development, giving young people the opportunity to explore different paths and enhance their skills. A significant part of my course focuses on employability, where I conduct workshops on the importance of employability skills and guide young people in further developing in this area. My goal is to help them unlock their potential and broaden their options, whether that involves personal development, employment, apprenticeships, further courses, or university. I am deeply passionate about what I do and feel privileged to support individuals at different stages of their journeys. Helping them realise their potential and make a positive impact on the world is incredibly rewarding, and I am dedicated to continuing this vital work.</p>

						<p>With over two decades of dedicated experience in enhancing outcomes for families, children, and adults, I bring a wealth of expertise to the field of youth development and advocacy. As a JNC-qualified Professional Youth Worker, I have honed essential skills for effectively engaging and guiding young individuals towards making meaningful life choices. Currently, I am pursuing a Master's Degree in Advanced Youth Work Practice at Cardiff Metropolitan University to further develop my knowledge and practice in this area. My background includes a tenure with the Youth Offending Team, where I attained a Professional Certificate in Effective Practice (Youth Justice), further enhancing my ability to address complex challenges in youth justice. I have also held roles with the Probation Service, Public Sector Housing, and the Local Safeguarding Children's Board. Presently, I serve as an Early College Adviser, specialising in motivating and equipping 14-16-year-olds for academic and vocational success. Through a combination of dedication and adept student engagement, I consistently deliver positive outcomes, contributing to the educational and professional advancement of young people.

						Should we go with something like the above, or would it be better to focus on what inspired us to
						start the organization? focusing on the young people etc and not ourselves?<br>Or should we do both?

						Example: At Break Down Barriers, we started with a simple belief: every young person, no matter their background,
						deserves the chance to succeed. In Bristol, too many young people face challenges that stop them from 
						staying in education and reaching their potential.<br><br>
						That's why we exist — to break down those barriers. Through
						personalised mentoring programmes, we help young people overcome obstacles, grow their confidence, and build a 
						brighter future.<br><br>
						This isn't about what we do; it's about who we do it for. Every decision, programme, and connection
						we make is focused on supporting the young people we serve. Together, we're building a community where everyone has the 
						opportunity to thrive.
